# Expense Tracker

## About 
Expense tracker is a React app to track your day-to-day expenses, I'm building this app as a refresher of the React framework, 
this project is part of the [React The Complete Guide course curriculum.](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
